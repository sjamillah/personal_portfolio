          <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
          <p>
            I'm SSOZI Jamillah, and my love for technology began when I was just
            a curious kid, fascinated by the glow of computer screens and the
            thrill of coding. I spent hours tinkering with computers, amazed by
            the endless things they could do. Each time I pressed a key, it felt
            like I was opening a door to a world where anything was possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I'm a student at African Leadership University (ALU) in Kigali,
            Rwanda, studying Software Engineering. Here, surrounded by the
            bustling energy of campus life, I'm on a mission to learn all about
            data science and full-stack web development. From the moment I
            arrived at ALU, I knew I was in for an incredible adventure. With
            determination in my heart and a passion for technology driving me
            forward, I threw myself into my studies. I've learned so much—from
            mastering Python and Java to exploring HTML, CSS, and more. Each
            lesson has been like a stepping stone, bringing me closer to my
            dream of becoming a tech expert. But my journey doesn't end in the
            classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my studies, I'm always exploring new things. Whether it's
            diving into the world of data science, experimenting with cooking,
            or getting lost in a good book, I'm always eager to learn and grow.
